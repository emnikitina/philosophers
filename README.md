# philosophers
This program is a simulation of "thinking philosophers". Some philosophers sit at a round table. There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table. There are also forks on the table, one fork between each pair of philosophers The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep. While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping, while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping, and while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking. Philosopher need 2 fork one in each hand. When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when a philosopher dies of starvation. Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.
The program takes the following arguments: number_of_philosophers, time_to_die, time_to_eat, time_to_sleep, number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat. Time args are presented in milliseconds. number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat is optional argument. If all philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat times, the simulation stops.
Threads are used for each philosopher. The forks are protected with a mutex for each of them to prevent philosophers from duplicating forks.
A bonus part has some different rules: all the forks are put in the middle of the table, philosophers are a processes instead of threads, forks is represented by
a semaphore.
